## About

**Stipple Effect** is an image editor designed for creating and animating pixel art. The program is purpose-built and tailor-made to seamlessly facilitate and enhance my established workflow for the pixel art that I produce as an [indie game developer](https://flinkerflitzer.itch.io/) and [freelancer](https://www.fiverr.com/jordanbunke).

## Features

* Projects consist of layers and frames
* [Advanced brush modes that combine the primary and secondary color in interesting ways](https://i.imgur.com/USum331.gif)
* Rigorous state management
* [Granular undo/redo](https://i.imgur.com/kL84ffp.gif)
* Onion skinning
* Layer-frame locking
* Animation playback
* [Live animating](https://i.imgur.com/n2H93Xr.gif)
* [Animation importing from sprite sheets](https://i.imgur.com/4OoRW4Q.gif)
* And much more!

## External Dependencies

* [Delta Time](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time) - my lightweight graphics library that handles GUI and execution loop boilerplate
* Animation Encoder - wrapper for Square's [gifencoder](https://github.com/square/gifencoder) that I intend to extend for video exporting purposes
