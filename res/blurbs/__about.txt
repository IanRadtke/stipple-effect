{Stipple Effect} is a pixel art editor and animator.

It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is built on top of {Delta Time}, the developer's
proprietary Java game library, which handles most of the rendering boilerplate, menu element logic,
and other low-level systems and behaviours.

Message from Jordan, the developer:

I initially built Stipple Effect as a private tool. I had been using {Paint.NET} for pixel art for
years, but as I became a more experienced programmer and artist, I realized that Paint.NET was not
conducive with the kind of workflow that I wanted to cultivate to improve my work and to be more
efficient. Furthermore, Paint.NET has no utilities or features for animation, and it is painstaking
to draw animation frames without being able to quickly cycle through them as one works. These two
reasons came to be overwhelming enough that I abandoned the program and started working on my own
replacement.

Over the course of weeks of development, I started to feel good enough about Stipple Effect to flesh
it out and make it publicly available. I hope you get as much use out of the program as I do!
Please reach out with any feedback or questions!

If you get a lot of value out of the program, please consider supporting my work in one of the ways
below. The more I earn from Stipple Effect, the more time I can dedicate to its improvement.

Thank you!
