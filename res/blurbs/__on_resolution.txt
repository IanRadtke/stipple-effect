Stipple Effect's screen contents render at {960 x 540} pixels.
This canvas is then scaled up to the window size. As such,
the program is optimized to run fullscreen on {16:9} aspect
ratio screens with {1080p or 4K (2160p)} resolutions.

Note that the zoom percentage that is displayed in the bottom
bar also refers to the internal program resolution. That is
to say, a 32 x 32 canvas on 100% zoom on a 1080p screen is
actually being displayed at 200%, and will only be half as
big when the file is viewed at normal size in a program other
than Stipple Effect.
