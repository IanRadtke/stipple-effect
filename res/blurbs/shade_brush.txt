Shortcut: {D}

Works like the regular {Brush} tool, but shifts the color of a pixel that is {painted over} to one of
the colors next to it in the current palette {if the pixel's initial color is in the palette}.

Replace with left-adjacent color in palette: {Left Click & Drag}
Replace with right-adjacent color in palette: {Right Click & Drag}

Increment/decrement brush width: {Arrow Keys} or {Shift + Scroll Wheel}
