Stipple Effect allows for users to write scripts that fall into one of three categories:

> Automation scripts
> Preview scripts
> Color scripts

{Automation scripts} are scripts that are called from the main editor window that run a series of
program actions automatically. For example, a script can be written that reverses the frames in a
project. The full list of Stipple Effect program actions that can be executed via script are outlined
in the {scripting API} (abstract programming interface).

Type signature for automation scripts: {()} - (no parameters and void return)

{Preview scripts} allow for the transformation of the contents of the preview window. By default, the
preview window merely previews the contents of the project as they are. This can already be used in
a variety of ways, but it is made exponentially more powerful with scripting.

Valid type signatures for preview scripts:
> {(image -> image)}
> {(image[] -> image)}
> {(image -> image[])} - (only valid for projects with a single frame)

{Color scripts} transform an input color into an output color. They are useful for defining complex
transformation behaviours.

Type signature for color scripts: {(color -> color)}

Stipple Effect scripts are written in an extension dialect of my scripting language {DeltaScript}.
Script files can be written in the text editor of your choosing and use the file extension {.ses}.
However, {VS Code} is recommended, as the official syntax highlighting extension for Stipple Effect
scripting is only available with VS Code.
