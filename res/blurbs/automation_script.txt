Shortcut: {sc:AUTOMATION_SCRIPT}

Upload and run an automation script. Scripts are written in DeltaScript, which has been extended
for Stipple Effect's specifications and needs.

Automation scripts must have the type signature {()} (no parameters and void return).

For more information on DeltaScript and its Stipple Effect extension, you can check the {Script} tab,
which links to the {scripting API} and {language documentation}.
