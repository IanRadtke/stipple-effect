Shortcut: {sc:AUTOMATION_SCRIPT}

Upload and run an automation script. Scripts are written in DeltaScript, which has been extended
for Stipple Effect's specifications and needs.

Automation scripts must fulfill the contract {()}.
That is to say, they take no parameters and return nothing.

For more information on DeltaScript and its Stipple Effect extension, you can consult the {Script}
tab, or visit the GitHub repositories for {Stipple Effect} and {Delta Time} for the full documentation.
