Shortcut to toggle: {Ctrl + 1}

Enabling one of the onion skin modes will render translucent previews of {one or both of the frames}
{adjacent} to the active frame under the editing layer. Note that the onion skins may not be visible
if there are no changes between frames, or there is no transparency on the active layer at the active
frame for the onion skins to show up through.

This feature is an animation aid only. Onion skins are {not preserved when the project is exported}
as one of the non-native export types (PNG, GIF, MP4, etc.). Thus, toggling the onion skin mode does
not constitute a state change.
