Shortcut to toggle: {sc:TOGGLE_ONION_SKIN}

Onion skins can be enabled on layers whose cels are not linked. Onion skins are translucent projections
of {a set number of cels preceding and/or following} the active cel, rendered either {under or above}
the active cel.

Note that onion skins may not be visible if there are no changes between frames, or if there is no
transparency in the active cel for the onion skins to show up through.

This feature is an animation aid only. Onion skins are {not preserved when the project is exported}
as one of the non-native export types (PNG, GIF, MP4, etc.). Thus, toggling the onion skin on or
off does not constitute a state change. However, onion skin configurations are saved as part of the
native file type data.
