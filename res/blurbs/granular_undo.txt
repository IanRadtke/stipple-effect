Shortcut: {sc:GRANULAR_UNDO}

Return to a previous state within a single operation.

For example, this can be used to navigate every stage of a brush stroke, rather than having to undo
the entire stroke and attempt to replicate the initial part of the line again.

{Note:} For the sake of performance, Stipple Effect does not calculate whether the before and after
state of an operation alters the project's contents. That is to say, drawing over a pixel with the
same color that was already there will still produce a new state on the undo/redo stack. Thus, a
granular undo/redo operation will sometimes appear to have done nothing, but it will in fact have
altered the project state.
